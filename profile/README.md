    <h2>What is a Percentage?</h2>
    
    <p>The word "percentage" comes from the Latin "per centum," meaning "by the hundred." A percentage is a way to express a number as a fraction of 100. It's represented by the percent sign (%). When we say 50%, we mean 50 out of 100, or 50/100, which simplifies to ½.</p>
    
    <p>Percentages are everywhere in daily life:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sales and discounts in stores</li>
        <li>Interest rates on loans and savings accounts</li>
        <li>Battery charge indicators on devices</li>
        <li>Nutrition information on food packaging</li>
        <li>Test scores and academic grades</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>The Basic Percentage Formula</h2>
    
    <p>The fundamental percentage formula is straightforward:</p>
    
    <div class="formula">
        Percentage = (Part / Whole) × 100
    </div>
    
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Part</strong> is the portion of the whole you're interested in</li>
        <li><strong>Whole</strong> is the total or complete amount</li>
        <li>The result is multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="example">
        <h3>Example 1: Calculating a Test Score</h3>
        <p>Suppose you answered 45 questions correctly out of 60 on a test. What percentage did you score?</p>
        <p>Using the formula:</p>
        <p>Percentage = (45 / 60) × 100 = 0.75 × 100 = 75%</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Different Types of Percentage Problems</h2>
    
    <p>While the basic formula remains the same, percentage calculations can be categorized into three main types:</p>
    
    <h3>1. Find the Percentage of a Number</h3>
    <p>This is when you want to know what a certain percentage is of a given number.</p>
    <div class="formula">
        Result = (Percentage / 100) × Number
    </div>
    
    <div class="example">
        <h4>Example 2: Calculating a Discount</h4>
        <p>A $200 jacket is on sale for 25% off. What's the discount amount?</p>
        <p>Discount = (25 / 100) × 200 = 0.25 × 200 = $50</p>
        <p>Sale price = $200 - $50 = $150</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>2. Find What Percentage One Number Is of Another</h3>
    <p>This is the standard percentage calculation we saw earlier.</p>
    <div class="formula">
        Percentage = (Part / Whole) × 100
    </div>
    
    <div class="example">
        <h4>Example 3: Calculating Battery Percentage</h4>
        <p>Your phone shows 3,450 mAh remaining out of a 4,000 mAh battery. What percentage remains?</p>
        <p>Percentage = (3,450 / 4,000) × 100 = 0.8625 × 100 = 86.25%</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>3. Find the Whole When the Percentage Is Known</h3>
    <p>This is useful when you know a part and what percentage it represents of the whole.</p>
    <div class="formula">
        Whole = Part / (Percentage / 100)
    </div>
    
    <div class="example">
        <h4>Example 4: Determining Total Sales</h4>
        <p>A salesperson made $8,400 in commission, which is 7% of their total sales. What were their total sales?</p>
        <p>Total sales = 8,400 / (7 / 100) = 8,400 / 0.07 = $120,000</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Calculating Percentages</h2>
    
    <p>Let's break down the percentage calculation process into simple steps:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Identify the part and the whole:</strong> Determine which number represents the portion and which represents the total.</li>
        <li><strong>Divide the part by the whole:</strong> This gives you a decimal number between 0 and 1.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiply by 100:</strong> Convert the decimal to a percentage by moving the decimal point two places to the right.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the percent sign:</strong> Don't forget to include the % symbol to indicate it's a percentage.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Common Percentage Conversions</h2>
    
    <p>It's helpful to memorize some common percentage conversions:</p>
    
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Fraction</th>
            <th>Decimal</th>
            <th>Percentage</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1/2</td>
            <td>0.5</td>
            <td>50%</td>
        </tr>

            <td>0.1</td>
            <td>10%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1/100</td>
            <td>0.01</td>
            <td>1%</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h2>Calculating Percentage Increase and Decrease</h2>
    
    <p>Percentages are often used to measure changes. The formula for percentage change is:</p>
    
    <div class="formula">
        Percentage Change = [(New Value - Old Value) / Old Value] × 100
    </div>
    
    <div class="example">
        <h3>Example 5: Calculating Price Increase</h3>
        <p>A product's price increased from $80 to $100. What's the percentage increase?</p>
        <p>Percentage Increase = [(100 - 80) / 80] × 100 = (20 / 80) × 100 = 0.25 × 100 = 25%</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="example">
        <h3>Example 6: Calculating Population Decrease</h3>
        <p>A town's population decreased from 12,000 to 11,400. What's the percentage decrease?</p>
        <p>Percentage Decrease = [(11,400 - 12,000) / 12,000] × 100 = (-600 / 12,000) × 100 = -0.05 × 100 = -5% (or 5% decrease)</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Practical Applications of Percentage Calculations</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Financial Calculations</h3>
    <p>Percentages are crucial in finance for calculating:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Interest rates on loans and savings</li>
        <li>Investment returns</li>
        <li>Mortgage payments</li>
        <li>Credit card APRs</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="example">
        <h4>Example 7: Calculating Simple Interest</h4>
        <p>You deposit $5,000 in a savings account with a 3% annual interest rate. How much interest will you earn in one year?</p>
        <p>Interest = (3 / 100) × 5,000 = 0.03 × 5,000 = $150</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>2. Shopping and Discounts</h3>
    <p>Understanding percentages helps you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Calculate sale prices</li>
        <li>Compare discounts</li>
        <li>Determine final prices after markdowns</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="example">
        <h4>Example 8: Stacked Discounts</h4>
        <p>An item originally priced at $200 has a 20% discount, plus an additional 15% off the sale price. What's the final price?</p>
        <p>First discount: (20 / 100) × 200 = $40 → Sale price = $160</p>
        <p>Second discount: (15 / 100) × 160 = $24 → Final price = $136</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>3. Statistics and Data Analysis</h3>
    <p>Percentages help interpret data by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Showing proportions in surveys</li>
        <li>Calculating growth rates</li>
        <li>Comparing parts to wholes</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Tips for Solving Percentage Problems</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Always identify what represents 100%:</strong> This is your baseline for comparison.</li>
        <li><strong>Convert percentages to decimals when multiplying:</strong> Move the decimal point two places left (25% becomes 0.25).</li>
        <li><strong>Convert decimals to percentages when presenting results:</strong> Move the decimal point two places right (0.35 becomes 35%).</li>
        <li><strong>Use the percentage formula triangle:</strong> Cover the variable you want to find to see which operation to perform.</li>
        <li><strong>Check your answers:</strong> Does the result make sense in context?</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Common Percentage Calculation Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
    
    <p>Even with a simple formula, errors can occur. Watch out for these common mistakes:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Confusing the part and the whole:</strong> Always double-check which number represents the total.</li>
        <li><strong>Forgetting to multiply by 100:</strong> This leaves you with a decimal instead of a percentage.</li>
        <li><strong>Misplacing decimal points:</strong> Especially when converting between percentages and decimals.</li>
        <li><strong>Adding percentages of different wholes:</strong> Percentages can't be added unless they relate to the same base amount.</li>
        <li><strong>Assuming percentage points and percentages are the same:</strong> A 5% increase from 10% is 10.5%, not 15%.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advanced Percentage Concepts</h2>
    
    <p>Once you've mastered basic percentage calculations, you can explore more advanced applications:</p>
    
    <h3>1. Compound Percentage Changes</h3>
    <p>When multiple percentage changes occur sequentially, they don't simply add up.</p>
    
    <div class="example">
        <h4>Example 9: Compound Interest</h4>
        <p>You invest $1,000 at 5% annual interest compounded yearly for 3 years.</p>
        <p>Year 1: 1,000 × 1.05 = $1,050</p>
        <p>Year 2: 1,050 × 1.05 = $1,102.50</p>
        <p>Year 3: 1,102.50 × 1.05 = $1,157.63</p>
        <p>The total growth is 15.76%, not 15%, due to compounding.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>2. Percentage Points vs. Percentages</h3>
    <p>A percentage point is an absolute unit (1% = 1 percentage point), while a percentage change is relative.</p>
    
    <div class="example">
        <h4>Example 10: Interest Rate Increase</h4>
        <p>If an interest rate rises from 4% to 6%:</p>
        <p>• The increase is 2 percentage points</p>
        <p>• The percentage increase is (6-4)/4 × 100 = 50%</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>3. Reverse Percentages</h3>
    <p>Finding the original amount when you know the final amount and the percentage change.</p>
    
    <div class="example">
        <h4>Example 11: Original Price After Discount</h4>
        <p>A shirt costs $56 after a 30% discount. What was the original price?</p>
        <p>$56 represents 70% of the original price (100% - 30%)</p>
        <p>Original price = 56 / 0.70 = $80</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Percentage Calculation Tools and Resources</h2>
